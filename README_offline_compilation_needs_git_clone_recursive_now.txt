If you want to build this sources offline, remember to clone this with option --recursive
git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns.git cjdns --recursive

or if you did just clone you can here run command:
git submodule update --init --recursive
and it will download external repositories with libuv and other libs that we include in our builds.


This file has a long name so no one git clones and goes to vacation to North Pole and then is dissapointed ;)
